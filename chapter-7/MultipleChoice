1. A polymorphic function

  d) may resolve to values of different types, depending on inputs

2. Two functions named f and g have types:
   f :: Char -> String
   g :: String :: [String]
   The composed function g . f has the type:

  b) Char -> [String]
 
3. A function f has the type:
   f :: Ord a => a -> a -> Bool
   When we apply f to one numeric value, what is the type now?

  d) (Ord a, Num a) => a -> Bool

4. a function with type (a -> b) -> c

  b) is a higher order function

5. Given the following definition of f:
   f :: a -> a
   f x = x
   What is the type of f True

  a) f True :: Bool
